About MC360:
============

MC360 is a GUI skin for XBMC, XBOX MEDIA CENTER is a homebrew application for a modded XBOX 1,
it is in no way useable on an Xbox 360.

MC360, 'Media Center 360', is the first creation from Team Blackbolt. Taking the outstanding look 
and design of the Xbox 360 dashboard, and bringing it to Xbox Media Center. It has taken a long time to 
create and we feel that it is something special. It is the first skin to use all the new features the 
2.1 version of XBMC has to offer.

This folder is different depending where you installed to. When you have copied it 
over boot up Xbox Media Center and go to the Appearance Options, Choose the MC360 
skin and leave it for a second,XBMC will reload with the new skin activated. 
Now you can select from the Custom Themes using the Theme chooser.

Upgrading previous MC360 versions to a newer one:
=================================================

Do NOT overwrite MC360, many files change and leaving old files will result in adverse
effects. Make sure you fully delete your MC360 folder from XBMC/Skins/ and then upload
the new one found in this readme. You can do this by changing your skin to the default
skin, PM3, and then FTP to your xbox, delete the MC360 folder and replace it with the
new version.
